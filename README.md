# Horiseon

## Description

The motivation was to Refactor the existing code of Horiseon to follow the accesibility standards and the site is optimized for the search engines.     

the problems it solved are :
The webpage not being accessible for people who have disabilities
Horiseon being prone to litigation
Not rank higher in search engines like Google

I have learned how to use semantic tags and make the ccs more efficient by removing repeated lines of code in accordance with the DRY principle.
